		<h4>Why this site is janky?</h4>
		<p>I'm currently building this website hosted on GitHub Pages. I'm a web dev novice, but 
		I'm currently reading Ultralearning by Scott Young, so I wanted to challenge myself and 
		see how quickly I could build a website that didn't feel embarrassing to show people.</p>

		<p>As such, it's pretty crappy right now. The exciting part is it changes almost every day.</p>

		<p>If you want to know: I started on March 11, 2023. </p>
