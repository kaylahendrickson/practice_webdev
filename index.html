<h4>Wondering why this site is janky?</h4>
<p>I'm currently building this website hosted on GitHub Pages. I'm a web dev novice, but 
I'm currently reading Ultralearning by Scott Young, so I wanted to challenge myself and 
see how quickly I could build a website that didn't feel embarrassing to show people.</p>

<p>As such, it pretty crappy right now. The exciting part is it changes almost every day.</p>

<p>If you want to know: I started on March 11, 2023. </p>
